        <h3>Impact Justice</h3>
        <a href="https://impactjustice.org/" target="_blank">Impact Justice</a> is a nonprofit organization focused on criminal justice reform. 
        The Research and Action Center (RAC) serves as the research arm of the organization, 
        and conducts research on evaluating governmental and community-based organizations,
         analyzing disparities in the criminal justice system across race, gender, and sexual orientation, 
         and providing training and technical assistance around data management and processes for partner agencies and organizations. </p>
         <p> <b>Project Description: </b>The RAC is seeking assistance for a current project that is looking at crime and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
         In this exploratory project, we are tracking weekly arrest trends and comparing these trends to the previous year. 
         We are looking for someone to help create and maintain a dataset on arrest trends between 2019 and 2020 and, 
         if possible, begin analyzing this data.
